Add a bit of color coding to the documentation for linux commands.
You may have used the man command before.
man grep
man sudo
man ffmpeg
These are the manuals for all your linux commands, but everything is black and white. This script adds a red color to the program flag options, and gives a green color to any underlined text in the document. Result: more easily readible and digestable manpages.

To customize the colors, go familiarize yourself with the shell color codes here: https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting
Then, as root, go edit this file: /usr/local/bin/man
