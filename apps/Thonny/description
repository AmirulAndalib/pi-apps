Thonny is a simple Python IDE with features useful for learning programming.

It comes with a debugger which is able to visualize all the conceptual steps
taken to run a Python program (executing statements, evaluating expressions,
maintaining the call stack). There is a GUI for installing 3rd party packages
and special mode for learning about references.
