Boot a full Android OS on systems running Wayland based desktop environments.
No virtualization or emulation involved, just a namespaces container, so the performance is indistinguishable from natively installing Android on the same hardware.

Installed apps will be added to the Menu, and can be run separately from the familiar Android UI.
This won't work on operating systems using X11, you must switch to Wayland.

To run: Menu -> Accessories -> Waydroid
To run in a terminal: waydroid show-full-ui

NOTE for touchscreen users: make sure to go into your touchscreen settings and enable multi touch, not mouse emulator.

SECURITY NOTE: For better compatibility with game controllers, this script enables udev and uevent access to Waydroid during installation. These options are usually off by default for people who want to test Android malware in a sandbox. To disable:
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.udev false
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.uevent false
