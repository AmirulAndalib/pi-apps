Boot a full Android OS on systems running Wayland based desktop environments.
No virtualization or emulation involved, just a namespaces container, so the performance is indistinguishable from natively installing Android on the same hardware.

Installed apps will be added to the Menu, and can be run separately from the familiar Android UI.
This won't work on operating systems using X11, you must switch to Wayland.

To run: Menu -> Accessories -> Waydroid
To run in a terminal: waydroid show-full-ui
