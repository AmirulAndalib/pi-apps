Optimized 3D slicing software for BambuLab and other printers
This is based on PrusaSlicer, but brings project-based workflows, more features, and better default presets.
This will not render the 3D models as smoothly as Cura will, as it is a flatpak running under xwayland.

To run: Menu -> Graphics -> BambuStudio
To run in a terminal: flatpak run  --command=entrypoint --file-forwarding com.bambulab.BambuStudio
