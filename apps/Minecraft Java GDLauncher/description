GDLauncher is simple, yet powerful Minecraft launcher with a strong focus on the user experience. This is a CUSTOM BUILD of GDLauncher for ARM32/ARM64 support.

The Open Source version of GDLauncher has been discontinued by upstream GorillaDevs as of January 2023. As such, this launcher will receieve no further updates.

Although GDLauncher is currently functional, all users are encouraged to use Minecraft Java Prism Launcher (https://pi-apps.io/install-app/install-minecraft-java-prism-launcher-on-raspberry-pi/).
GDLauncher is heavy (high RAM and CPU usage) due to being built on the Electron (Chromium) framework.
By comparison, Prism Launmcher is very lightweight and has all the missing features and more from below.

Features of the launcher:
- Microsoft, Mojang, and PC GamePass Account support
- Curseforge and FTB Mod and Modpack browser and updater
- Automatic Java 8/17 installation
- Fabric and Forge mod loading

Features NOT in this launcher (but available in Prism Launcher):
- Modrinth ATLauncher and Technic Mod and Modpack browser and updater
- Quilt mod loading
- Old Snapshots

NOTE: The use of performance enhancing mods is highly encouraged, such as optifine with Optifabric and Fabric/Forge or Sodium/Lithium/Starlight Fabric Mods.

To run: Menu -> Games -> GDLauncher
To run in a terminal: MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3 gdlauncher

theofficialgman's custom meta repo is used for arm32 and arm64 native libraries. (https://github.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm32 https://github.com/theofficialgman/piston-meta-arm64)
This supports all currently released versions of minecraft.

Note: GDLauncher GitHub/Discord does NOT support this CUSTOM BUILD, any issues should be directed to the Pi-Apps Discord or Pi-Apps GitHub issues.
